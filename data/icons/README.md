These are the custom icons used in the program, built using inkscape.

Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to update these icons automatically, so it is up to the artist to export a new "optimized" svg.
Just make sure when you save your edits, export to this folder and to raw.

Sorry!

Also, any of the `-symbolic.svg` are taken from GNOME's Icon Library. All of the rights are reserved to them.
