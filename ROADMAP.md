* Create a standardized gobject interface for the main window
* Create gobject api for playing the music and interacting with the main window
* Support `owncloud/music`'s APIs (subsonic, ampache XML and JSON)

# Current TODOs (Subject: Create server selection startup window)

* Make ServerChoiceWidget.server-type a string
* Create a object containing the properties of a singular server
* Make server properties window
